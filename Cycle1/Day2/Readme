I have only completed part of day 2 
I have done these topics-
 Encode categorical columns (one-hot or ordinal as appropriate)
 Normalize numerical features (e.g., MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler)
 Select features using correlation/mutual information
 Create 2 interaction features (e.g., stress Ã— work_hours, Sleep vs Stress)
